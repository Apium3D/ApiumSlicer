# ApiumSlicer
ApiumSlicer is a GCODE-generator for Apium 3D printers used for industrial and medial appliances. ApiumSlicer is a fork 
of PrusaResearch's [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/tree/master) which itself is based on [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap 
community.

### Which platforms are supported?

ApiumSlicer can be compiled for Windows, macOS and Linux (not all distributions supported). Currently, precompiled binaries 
are only available for Windows (10/11) and macOS (ARM architecture).

###### Precompiled binaries for our customers are available  [here](https://www.download.apiumtec.com).


### What is ApiumSlicer's license?

ApiumSlicer is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 and is a fork of PrusaSlicer which is 
originally based on Slic3r by Alessandro Ranellucci.

### Note of Thanks 
The Apium Team would like to take this opportunity to thank Prusa Research, 
the open-source community, all supporters of the PrusaSlicer project, Alessandro 
Ranellucci, the Slic3r team, as well as all other contributors. Without the incredible 
work of all these individuals, a project like this would not be possible!
